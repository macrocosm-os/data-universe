    A simple dummy protocol representation which uses bt.Synapse as its base.
    This protocol helps in handling dummy request and response communication between
    the miner and the validator.

    Attributes:
    - dummy_input: An integer value representing the input request sent by the validator.
    - dummy_output: An optional integer value which, when filled, represents the response from the miner.

        Deserialize the dummy output. This method retrieves the response from
        the miner in the form of dummy_output, deserializes it and returns it
        as the output of the dendrite.query() call.

        Returns:
        - int: The deserialized response, which in this case is the value of dummy_output.

        Example:
        Assuming a Dummy instance has a dummy_output value of 5:
        >>> dummy_instance = Dummy(dummy_input=4)
        >>> dummy_instance.dummy_output = 5
