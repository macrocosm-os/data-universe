Bitcoin is really trying to liquidate as much people as possible and if we do get another pump, $300 million will get completely wrecked and liquidated. Let me write show you. Only couple of hours ago, Bitcoin got a first push towards side to take the liquidity exactly below the recent low. So what does that exactly mean for all people that entered a long position? probably they are setting their stop loss exactly below the recent low and before we can actually get a bigger push towards the upside we need to wreck them we need to stop them out and only after they wrecked Bitcoin has gotten a beautiful push towards the upside and literally the exact same thing happened exactly above the recent high right here take the liquidity right there and of course after everyone is racked do get a bigger rotation back towards downside and it really proves my point. Liquidity in the market is everything. Before we are getting a significant pump and also a significant dump, we need to wreck the most amount of people in the shortest amount of time. And yes, if you right now pay attention to the past 24-hour liquidations, it really does look like over 444 million of longs and shorts have gotten wrecked, have gotten liquidated. But pay right now attention to exactly what other people have been doing in the market in the past couple of hours. Bitcoin definitely has gotten a push down. The CVD indicator also got quite a major push towards side while the open interest indicator is seeing a push towards the upside. So what does that exactly mean? People entered heavily into their short or sell positions exactly at this specific area. And now logically thinking, if we want to wreck them, of course, ideally right now, we should get another major push towards the upside, which is then going to be some kind of a short squeeze. And right now, pay attention to the liquidations on the twoe time frame. Yes, bigger liquidations on Bitcoin are going to be approximately at $117,000 US area where yes, almost $300 million is going to get completely wrecked and completely completely liquidated even right now if we do pay attention to our liquidation heat map right here. Yes, the biggest liquidations are still going to be literally exactly above the recent highs right here. That is right now why ideally in the next couple of hours I would still like to get another major push toward the upside which is then going to mean we are going to again wrecked the most amount of people in the shortest amount of time. That is right now why I do remain in my long position on Bitcoin in a long position on XRP and also in a long position on SUI. And later in the video, I\'m going to share with you exactly what is probably going to be my next trade. And maybe surprisingly for you, it is not going to be a long position, but actually a short position.", "start": 0.0, "duration": 158.4}, {"text": "However, I do want to share with you a trading setup for another long position on Bitcoin where we are literally trading as right now. But nevertheless, before we do talk about that, I would really appreciate for you to smash up the like button because 1,000 likes are really possible. And also, thank you for subscribing to the channel. Let me right now share with you why we are getting a rejection back towards the downside in the first place. Yes, we know we have taken the liquidity exactly above the recent high. But the reality is what if we zoom out a little bit and right now go with our anchored VWAP anchor it exactly at this previous alltime high. It looks like Bitcoin for the past couple of days has simply been trading exactly at some kind of a local area of resistance. Not only that, when we go with our channel, remember the SNE channel I mentioned already couple of days ago. You can right now see we hit the top of our SNE channel. We hit the anchored VWAP and exactly from this specific area, we are right now seeing a very small push toward the downside. Of course, once again, most importantly, we are taking as much liquidity as possible. Not only above the recent highs right here, but of course also exactly below the recent lows. But let me right now also share with you exactly at what area is Bitcoin trading as of right now. Because yes, with this specific push towards upside, we took the liquidity exactly below the recent low. But also right now what has been happening for the past couple of hours with this entire push down. Not only we took the liquidity below this specific recent low but also we are right now trading exactly at this specific low 114.75 US area. So what we are right now going to do all we have to do is to go again with our channel connecting our highs expanding this one towards downside and we can right now say Bitcoin for the past couple of days simply has been trading in some kind of a horizontal range. Usually once we get a rotation back towards the upside we can then be expecting a rotation back towards downside of our range another rotation back up another rotation back towards downside. And there is actually a very simple theory, a very simple strategy we can right now apply in our horizontal range and it\'s going to be trade the range until it actually breaks. We are being more bullish exactly at the bottom of the range. We are being more bearish exactly at the top of the range. And what we can right now also do right here measuring the entire range with our volume. This right here is going to be something very important because the reality is we are right now below the very important value area low, the most important volume level right now of the entire range right here. So right now Bitcoin really needs to get a push towards the upside reclaiming the value area low.", "start": 158.4, "duration": 158.4}, {"text": "And in that case, for sure, we can then look for another rotation back towards the upside, ideally towards the top of our horizontal range, towards the area of $117,000. Fortunately for us, yes, we are right now already taking the liquidity exactly below the recent low. But of course, we need to right wait for some kind of a sign of strength for Bitcoin to then finally reclaim the value area low. And let\'s see after that if we are going to be able to get another push toward the upside. Now the reality is with the entire push down right here on the 1 hour time frame. Unfortunately the bullish market structure is right now broken. What exactly do I have in mind? Pay right now attention to the previous higher highs and also higher lows forming on the 1 hour time frame. We\'re going to push towards the upside. Higher low. Higher high. Higher low. Another higher high. Another higher low and another higher high with the entire push down. Unfortunately, we took out not only one low right here, but also the second low, which could right now mean market structure, bullish market structure on the 1 hour time frame is right now broken. So, this right here is actually going to be some kind of a bearish Bitcoin indication. That is why I\'m as right now telling to you ideally in the next couple of hours, we want to reclaim our value area low as soon as possible. If Bitcoin is actually going to be able to do that for sure, I am looking then for a rotation back towards the upside towards our much higher and much better price target which then definitely is going to be another major liquidity level and of course also another major golden Fibonacci ratio at approximately 117 and 118,000 US area and only after we are going to hit this specific price target ideally then we are looking for a bigger retracement back towards side. Let\'s see right now what Bitcoin is going to do. Let\'s see if we are going to be able to get a s of strength above the value area low. Because if the value area low right here is not going to be reclaimed for sure, we can already expect lower targets. And to be honest, my next lower target on Bitcoin is going to be approximately $113,000 area. Now, additionally, what if we right now go with Bitcoin monthly returns? Yes, a lot of people say to me, bro, September usually it is a bearish month, but at least as of right now, clearly we are still being in a very nice positive of approximately, let\'s just say 8%. I would say like that, yes, potentially a rejection in September can actually happen. Why so? Because many different indicators on the daily time frame are being slightly more bearish. And more about the indicators slight. So right now my ideal scenario on Bitcoin is still going to be very simple. Knowing that many people have already entered a brand new short position, I would really like to see some kind of a push toward the upside for us to liquidate them. Why so?", "start": 316.8, "duration": 158.4}, {"text": "Because again bigger liquidations are going to be exactly above the recent high and only after we do get potentially of course another push towards the upside right here. We liquidate them. We hit our major price target. Let\'s see if then we are going to get a bigger retracement, a bigger correction towards the downside on the Bitcoin chart itself. So yes, again at the bottom of the range already at the area where we are as right now, we can be looking for a long position of Bitcoin adding to our position if the value area low right here is actually going to get reclaimed. If it\'s not going to be reclaimed right here, definitely a bearish Bitcoin indication and only in that case we can be looking for another push towards downside on the Bitcoin chart itself.

What we are right now going to do, let\'s go with all of those indicators on the daily time frame where we are right now going to notice Bitcoin. Yes, for the past couple of days still has been forming some kind of a lower high. On the RSI, we are seeing a higher high on the money flow indicator. We are right now already getting a confirmed hidden bearish divergence and the exact same thing is also right now happening on the money flow indicator. Those indications on the daily time frame are bearish indications for Bitcoin itself. Not only that, remember what we said yesterday on the daily time frame on the Akler stoastic CG oscillator, we are right now seeing a double top pattern. So all of those indications combined, yes, I am looking to be honest for some kind of a rejection of Bitcoin, but ideally I would still like to get another push up first and only then a bigger retracement back towards downside. Are we going to get a bounce at this specific area? I do not know. But of course, the reality is we do not even have to guess. Let\'s see if Bitcoin is going to be able to reclaim the value area low. If not, yes, a bigger push down can right now already happen on Bitcoin. And again, our first important price target is going to be $113,000 area. Why is this specific level such an important price target?", "start": 475.20000000000005, "duration": 158.4}, {"text": "Simply because if we zoom out on the 4hourly measuring the entire upper price action with volume, you\'re going to notice value area low on Bitcoin is going to come in exactly below the recent lows. That is why if we already get a push down, this specific price target is going to be the first major area of support you should right now definitely be aware of. Now, if you do ask me, bro, would I fire a short position at the area where Bitcoin is right now? To be honest, not really because again my major price target still has not been hit. Again, I am following my plan. I am not going to blindly enter a short position. And additionally, at the moment, if you look like that, we are still trading at the bottom of quite a significant horizontal range. And also knowing bigger liquidations are still going to be exactly above the recent highs. So, let\'s see if in the next couple of hours, first of all, Bitcoin is able to reclaim the value area low. If so, let\'s look for another push towards the upside and only then at this specific area of resistance, let\'s look for another short position on the Bitcoin chart itself.

All right. Hello and welcome to Camel Finance. I\'m your boy Camel and today I want to briefly talk about the CPI print we saw yesterday, interest rate cuts, context for the interest rate cuts, and then I want to kind of continue to beat this same drum of not getting sucked into the narrative, not moving the gold post, that kind of thing. I want to show you some context for where we are in this major four-year cycle and then you can take it or leave it. I also want to review the CBBI index and then drop a little bit of a speculation as to what is likely coming with these stable coins, the stable coin act. Of course, we\'ve been covering this for a long time on this channel on and off as new data presented itself. We\'ve been good at staying on top of that. So, I\'m going to kind of quickly review my idea for those stable coins and how they are really the Trojan horse for the CBDC\'s. And then I\'m going to show you something that kind of backs this up in a way that frankly is far more sinister than I was even thinking. It was kind of in the back of my mind it could be the case, but it\'s also now apparently happening in real time. Again, it\'s another one of these kind of tinfoil hat conspiracies that seems to manifest itself. And then, of course, we\'ll hop into some charts and check to see what\'s going on there. extraordinary strength under the hood for the stock market. I first of all wanted to give you a quick update on the indicator. Okay, the indicator website is now updated with the countdown. Okay, so there is now 20 days left before the prices are doubles. We\'ve got an official deadline for doubling the prices. So that means if you\'re already in, you have secured the lifetime discount regardless of what plan you\'re on. Okay, the plan you are currently paying will persist for lifetime. Anyone that signs up for the indicator on either one of the plans in the next 20 days will also secure those lifetime discount prices. And then once this countdown timer expires in 20 days time, the prices will double and there will be no further discounted prices. Also, I wanted to quickly shout out all the people that have shown us the different ways they use this indicator. And there\'s loads of them now. They\'re all on the website. I particularly wanted to show you this quick clip from Icy Boy here who has found a way to kind of take the indicator and use it in a completely different manner for which it was intended.", "start": 0.0, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "So you can go and watch this on the website if you\'re interested. But what he shows here is that he uses the daily time frame to find himself a window. And then he zooms into the 4hour time frame and ends up negating a bunch of the signals. He looks for a signal on the 4hour to confirm the daily cycle lows in. This enables him to get into the daily cycle low trade earlier than you otherwise would be able to. So, he\'s using 4hour cycle lows flashed by the indicator to get him earlier entries in the daily cycle low trade setups. So, I thought that was really, really cool. So, shout out to Icy for that one. Again, you can go and watch this on the website if you\'re interested. And again, you\'ve got 20 days left to secure the lifetime discount before we double the prices. Now, as I\'m sure you\'re probably well aware and as per the live stream yesterday, we got a roughly inline inflation print yesterday, it was kind of expected to be roughly in line or perceived to sticky because we know we\'ve had a counter trend wobble and we may even get one more perceived sticky inflation print next month and then of course the macro call of heading for deflation and a strong disinflationary trend should continue to play out. However, I think for the first time in a while the writing may well be on the wall. Okay, because having seen this inflation print come out, the bond market in aggregate is now using the bond futures to price in a rate cut with 96.2% probability for September\'s meeting. And I see a lot of people out here saying, \\"Well, this is really bullish. This is easier monetary policy. They\'re finally going to cut. They\'re behind the curve. This is good for markets.\\" But just keep in mind context is everything. Okay? A cut into normalization or aka a soft landing, which is inflation return into normal without a recession, is historically very bullish. Yes, panic cutting, which this is absolutely not panic cutting if it\'s already baked into the cake, right? Is also most of the time bullish when we look 3, 6, and 12 months out. However, when we are cutting into a recession or cutting into a slowdown, the market can usually withstand one, maybe two rate cuts before things get extremely red extremely fast. And you can see down the bottom here, 3, six, and 12 months out, bad things happen to the stock market following a cut into a slowdown. And given how far behind the curve we are, given how disinflationary the trend is for inflation, given how bad the labor market deterioration has been, and as if it\'s not been bad enough, they\'ve been revising these job numbers at record paces. Right? The Fed has essentially been caught red-handed now. And the BLS for engineering a controlled demolition and engineering a recession over the past six or so months. So, I think the case for this being cuts into a recession or cuts into a slowdown is stronger than ever. And I\'m sure the market is going to continue to perceive these as cuts into normalization, right?", "start": 147.66666666666666, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "And a soft landing. And therefore, my call is still that risk goes higher for a couple of months, okay, into the end of the year. And as I just said, but it is important. Historically speaking, the market can withstand one, maybe two rate cuts before it then comes tumbling down. But I think we have got a very big job here to actually see cuts into normalization and a soft landing and actually avoid a recession. I really don\'t think we\'re going to be able to do that. As ever, I\'m open to it. Right. If the market\'s going to keep going up relentlessly and there\'s no more bare markets and no more fouryear cycle lows, then I\'ve got a very good track record, a proven track record of staying on the trend. And of course, I\'m not cheering on a recession because my job as a trader is to make money. And it\'s far easier for me to make money in an environment where the market continually goes up and all dips are for buying, right? All cycle low trades resolve to new higher highs. But as I\'ve been showing every weekend on the weekend\'s deep dive, I think we are actually heading for this recessionary cut. And of course, as you can see down the bottom here, the context for that is quite bearish. three, six and 12 months after the first rate cut which potentially is September now. Okay, I say potentially unless this thing changes drastically, then I would say this is cemented that we are going to see a rate cut in September. So, you know, enjoy the party while it lasts, but keep the focus on where we are and the context of the macro. We were also covering in the last few videos that gold was going to be tariffed, okay? And maybe this would cause a giant short squeeze, but easy come, easy go with Trump these days, isn\'t it? And lots of his policies. And uh as quickly as the tariffs came for bars, they have now been removed. So we can scratch this one off and say, \\"Okay, that was a nothing burger.\\" Bob Lucas here also starting to throw around the idea, or let\'s not even call it the idea. Let\'s call it knowledge. Okay, Bob Lucas sharing knowledge and wisdom here in this tweet. He said, \\"Look, you\'ve spent two and a half years thinking about how you\'re going to handle the four-year cycle peak and what you will do and what you won\'t do, and now you\'re finally here. You\'re going to throw it all out the window once Mania takes control.\\" Okay. Okay. And I thought this chart beautifully illustrates this, right? For a long time, people were saying you buy at the four-ear cycle low, okay, and you sell kind of Q3, Q4 of this year, and then you target a 12-month bare market decline. And only once price has gotten 94% of the way through this bull phase, okay? Do suddenly the narratives like no more cycle, no more bare market, our pony forever, extended cycle, super cycle, Black Rockck\'s never going to allow an ETF draw down because it doesn\'t want its clients to lose money. Okay, insert your BS narrative here.", "start": 295.3333333333333, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "But just notice how as the tape turns greener and greener, the nonsense continues to proliferate. And it\'s our job as traders, okay, one of the biggest skill sets and advantages we can have over the market as traders is to be able to take a step back, view the sentiment objectively, and once it becomes extremely one-sided like it is starting to now, then we can take the opposite side of the trade. So just have a little conversation with yourself, right? If all through here your idea for this cycle was we\'re not selling until 2028 or we\'re diamond hand in or there\'s no more bare market then fine. You can at least say well I had an idea and I\'m sticking to my idea. But if all throughout here your idea was that we would get to Q3 Q4 and you would sell and now we\'re here. You\'re saying to yourself, well I don\'t really want to sell. I want to be a bag holder, right? I want to gamble on the idea that this fouryear cycle is just not going to show up. Right? then maybe have a conversation with yourself and ask yourself if you\'re being suckered into some kind of narrative or if you perhaps lack the discipline to stick to your original thesis. Now, if you have a very good reason for changing to new data as it becomes available, then fine, okay? It\'s not for me to tell you what\'s right or wrong. It\'s not for me to say with 100% certainty that selling in Q3 or Q4 is going to be in hindsight a good idea. It\'s just simply me saying, \\"Please consider it all. Don\'t allow the FOMO and the mania to sucker you in to becoming a bag holder and sitting through what is potentially a 70 plus bare market decline. So hopefully push cycle low one final push. Okay, I think worst case scenario we get this push weekly cycle low lower high cycle failure exit all the markets here. But as you can see we are probably pretty late in this four-year cycle now. But that\'s good because we can secure the bag and then target that four year cycle low. And that is where the QE bomb should show up. That is where the big gains in the shortest space of time should become available for the camel crew. And keeping in with this theme, okay, of being pretty late in this cycle, take a look at the CBPI. Now, this aggregates a bunch of onchain metrics and kind of cycle top indicators like the PI cycle top indicator. And it gives you a score from 0 to 100. And this is important because historically speaking, any print above about 85 is at least synonymous with local tops, if not major tops. Okay? And certainly once we get to above 95, it tends to be a exit the market and don\'t look back type of signal. In all three of the prior weekly cycle tops, we were above 80, okay? And that turned out to be pretty good. And right now, we just poked above 82 83 before having a little pullback. Now, at the hard right edge, what I speculate is going to happen is the CBBI down the bottom is likely going to reach a peak, something like this, up above 95 level, which is about here.", "start": 443.0, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "And as it does so, I speculate that Bitcoin is going to move into its final euphoric blowoff top peak before then they both come tumbling down. And remember, if all of this is occurring, okay, a CBBI above 85, certainly above 90, even 95 with the timing of the weekly cycles and the profile of the weekly cycles looking like it\'s ready to break down, okay, trend line breakdowns, confirmation fire, failed daily cycles, all the normal stuff we use to call local tops on this channel. Then for me that is going to be a big piece of confluence and confidence to take some profit to exit the major position that we have held for almost three years now since the lows and put our focus on being defensive whilst we target that four year cycle low to reallocate in 2026. Something else I just want to quickly make a note of here is as we are taking this approach okay as we are selling and as we are starting to say things like I believe this is the top or close enough to the top to call it the top and now is my time to start targeting that fouryear cycle low. What I want is for people to largely speaking not agree with me. Okay? I want people jumping up and down and calling me stupid. I want people to say, \\"No way. You\'re an idiot. Super cycle.\\" I want people to behave how they behaved with Micro Strategy. Okay? Those of you that have been here for a while will remember when we sold the top of Micro Strategy back here. Okay? You\'ll remember that people were queuing two blocks long to lynch me the moment I was invalidated on this trade and we went to new highs. Okay? You all remember back here that people were targeting me personally and attacking me personally for taking profit on a position that was acquired at the 4-year cycle lows. Okay, I nailed down a 17x on this trade because I took half off here because we couldn\'t rule out left translation at the time. Okay, but we traded this thing publicly in front of everyone. We bought the lows. Okay, we added multiple leverage positions on the way up and captured even more gains. We took half off of the core allocation here and we took the other half off at the top here before then ultimately buying it back after a 50% decline top to bottom and currently riding with whatever\'s left. Now, it is still the base case that this is not going to make a new high and is going to roll over and die and we\'re going to be locking in profits pretty sharpish on this trade. But again, note the sentiment back here. Okay, the sentiment back here was that I was a total clown. I was a total buffoon and a total idiot for selling the top. And I kept making videos and saying, \\"Good. Okay, good. I\'m glad that\'s what the masses think because if everyone was jumping up and down and cheering on short trades here and saying, \\"Yep, I\'ve also sold and no way this thing goes to new highs,\\" I would have been extremely worried. Okay? And so that is the type of sentiment I\'m looking to repeat when it comes to selling Bitcoin.", "start": 590.6666666666666, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "If I start to take some profit either in here or in here for Bitcoin and everyone is jumping up and down and telling me I\'m an idiot and a clown, okay, and that I don\'t understand what I\'m doing and that I\'m going to get my followers wrecked, then we\'re going to be taking note of that and we\'re going to be humbly using it as a tool to say, okay, we\'re probably are on the right side of the trade here and the opposite side of the herd. If when we sell, every man and his dog is jumping up and down screaming they shorted Bitcoin and they can\'t wait for the four year cycle low, then we can start to put on the idea that at the next weekly cycle low, there\'s going to be a bounce to another high and maybe then we can start to target Q1. Okay, but it will be important to push your emotions aside. Okay, take a step back and objectively observe the sentiment around the time that we start to sell the Bitcoin market. Last but not least, okay, put your tin foil hat on, okay? Because for a long time we\'ve been talking about how stable coins are probably going to be the CBDC\'s in disguise. And whilst they might not be true CBDC\'s, they will probably do some kind of rugpool on them later in life where they add the programmatic ability to those coins. They add the layers of tyranny to those stable coins later in life and then they end up being CBDC like even if they\'re not true CBDC\'s. This was the idea. And we also put a video out recently, which you can search for in the channel if you\'re interested, about how these stable coins have essentially forced crypto bros and the rest of the world to become buyers of last resort for the treasuries, okay? Funding the government years to come. And that\'s why they called this thing the genius bill or the genius act because it is just that genius, right? They figured out how to force the world to buy their treasuries through the use of these CBDC\'s in disguise that identify as stable coins. And for a long time, people were saying, \\"Yeah, well, this is really bullish Ethereum because they\'re all built on ETH and all that kind of thing.\\" And please do not misunderstand what I\'m saying here. Okay, this is not me saying ETH is going to go down from here. Okay, ETH is breaking out to new all-time highs. ETH looks extremely bullish at the moment, okay? You can\'t really argue with this, can you? Okay, look at this. Huge pump for ETH. Probably going to continue for a while longer. So, this is not me dogging on ETH or saying ETH is going to go down or anything like that. Okay. Often when I make a criticism of something under the hood for ETH, like the blockchain, the network, the people behind it, people start to call me a hater or whatever. That\'s not what this is. Okay. I am not trying to FUD your bags. I\'m not saying the price of ETH is going to go down. I hope that is extremely clear.", "start": 738.3333333333333, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "But what I am saying is a lot of people were talking about how ETH would be here for a long time because the stable coin act and these whole CBDC\'s being built on top of ETH would ensure it always has demand. It always has a use case and all of this kind of thing. Okay. But the reality is we are now moving to the next phase of this plan. The final phase of the stable coins will be dropping the blockchain altogether. And that is because Circle is going to launch ARC, a layer 1 blockchain dedicated to stable coins. Did you really think they were going to build the CBDC\'s on top of someone else\'s blockchain, right? Of course not. Absolutely no chance. But this is now the evolution. And this is actually pretty sinister if you think about it because this is the true first steps towards actually converting the stable coins from relatively harmless to CBDC like totally tyrannical programmatic money. And then of course the question I want you to ask yourself, okay? Because I already know the answer. I\'ve already made up my mind. But that doesn\'t matter, right? I just want you to ask yourself the question, okay? How much use case is there for something like Ethereum if we\'re going to move these stable coins over to their own blockchains? Okay, you may think there\'s a lot of use case, but I make the case under the hood there\'s a lot of problems with that blockchain. No one really wants it other than to pump their bags and either get more fiat or more Bitcoin. And again, this is not me clowning on this or being a hater because you can\'t argue with the charts, right? The charts are the truth. The charts don\'t lie. This is a huge pump for Ethereum. So, anyone that is making more fiat or using that fiat to buy more Bitcoin, you know, you\'re winning. You\'re doing your job. Okay? So, it\'s business. It\'s not personal. But if we are going to remove the stable coin use case from Ethereum, then how much future do you really think this blockchain has? One thing we\'re not wrong about at the moment though is the S&P 500 closing new alltime highs. I don\'t like being overly bullish. Okay, normally when I\'m overly bullish, the market will turn around and punish me. Something I cannot really get away from. Okay, first of all, we\'re early in the cycles. Okay, cycles doing cycle things. We\'re about to move this future cycle low window to the next one and target that. And that\'s happy days. Okay, but look at this. Okay, this is something that I don\'t know, man. I\'m going to show I\'m going to share it with you. Okay, don\'t judge me. The question I want to ask is why are all these pullbacks here getting smaller and smaller and smaller on the way up? Okay, and the only answer I\'ve got for you is because these are nesting ones and twos. Okay?", "start": 886.0, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "Now, if these are nesting ones and twos, which I believe they are, because otherwise we can\'t explain the fact each one of these pullbacks is getting shallower on the way up, then the only option out of here, okay, are 3 4 3 4 3 4 and then five later on. This is the only option, which means this is actually the making of the blowoff top. And the reason I am so excited about this, but also a bit hesitant, like I said, usually when I\'m super duper uber bullish, the market has to come back and be like, whoa, chill out camel. Okay, you\'re getting ahead of yourself, but I was talking about this with the members and I think with the slice crew as well. This whole thing reminds me a lot of the meltup post C19. Okay, this here we had this big crash for C19. We went back to alltime highs. We chopped and then we just went absolutely bananas. And I know in the context zoomed out like this, it doesn\'t look that insane. But anyone that has traded through this period of time right here, anyone that was in the stock market actively trading this thing during this time will know this blew everyone\'s mind. This was the most insanely bullish thing ever. Every morning I woke up thinking, \\"Okay, here comes the top.\\" And it just relentlessly went up. I could not believe the underlying strength for this move. This was absolutely bananas off of that C19 low. And to me that what we\'ve got at the moment is extremely reminiscent of that. Okay, all of the pullbacks are getting smaller and smaller. And the only explanation I have for that is because they are indeed nesting ones and twos at smaller wave degrees. And like I said earlier, that means we\'re going to go 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 5 on the way out of here, which is exactly what we did back here. This is already more relentless than the recovery from the C19 lows. And I think we\'re probably going to do it a lot quicker and a lot more vertical to be completely honest with you. Now again, I could easily be way too bullish here. Okay, I could. But if we\'re going to have a blowoff top before coming tumbling down in a big bare market recession like the weekend\'s deep dives have been suggesting, if we\'re going to start to head for those four year cycle lows for not just Bitcoin, but also for the S&P and gold, then doesn\'t ending in a firework type bang here make a lot of sense? I don\'t know. Okay, I don\'t know. Again, I\'m always cautious when I suddenly flip to being super duper uber bullish because typically speaking, the market will have a way of being like, \\"Chill out camel.\\" Okay, go home. You\'re drunk. Okay, but at the same time, if anyone, and I\'m being serious when I ask this, if anyone has another explanation for why each one of these is getting smaller on the way up, okay, I would love to hear it because as far as I\'m concerned, these are all nesting ones and twos. And that means, like I said a million times, we\'re about to go absolutely vertical out of here. There\'s no other way, okay?", "start": 1033.6666666666665, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "And the more that the market continues to just push to all-time highs, okay, and make smaller and smaller degree corrections, then the more this actually becomes the base case. So again, I\'m always cautious when I start to be talking extremely super duper uber bullish here. But then again, we are at the end of these four-ear cycles, okay? And that\'s where all the work tends to get covered. If I zoom out and go to this Bitcoin alltime price history index, you know, it is in the final push that all of the gains for the cycle get made. Okay, it\'s in the final few months that all of the gains for the cycle get made. It\'s in the final few months that all of the gains for the cycle get made. And we are now in the final few months where potentially all of the gains for the cycle are going to get made. So, I don\'t know, man. Let me know what you think. Am I too bullish? Do I need to calm down a bit? Maybe. Okay. But equally, we are late in those four year cycles and that tends to be where the quote banana zone occurs. Okay, so summon the banana with me. What else is there to say? Gold still not really moved, has it? But I think it\'s about to as I\'ve been saying over and over again. The reason I say that is I believe we\'ve reset the weekly cycle now. I believe this is the ABCDE complete with one and two. And now we\'re going to break out on three, four, and five. And I believe the senior miners already leading the way. Well, it\'s not even a belief anymore. They are clearly leading the way. So are the junior miners. So are the CJ positions. 17 handle now and gapping up. Okay. So happy days. And if you\'re a level three member, everything that will be accumulated down here is going to get dumped at the top of this weekly cycle as we then start to target the fourear cycle low for gold. And that\'s it. Love you all. Right? Have a fantastic rest of the week. Let me know what you think about the super duper uber bullish case.

All right. Hello and welcome to Camel Finance. I\'m your boy Camel and today I want to briefly talk about the CPI print we saw yesterday, interest rate cuts, context for the interest rate cuts, and then I want to kind of continue to beat this same drum of not getting sucked into the narrative, not moving the gold post, that kind of thing. I want to show you some context for where we are in this major four-year cycle and then you can take it or leave it. I also want to review the CBBI index and then drop a little bit of a speculation as to what is likely coming with these stable coins, the stable coin act. Of course, we\'ve been covering this for a long time on this channel on and off as new data presented itself. We\'ve been good at staying on top of that. So, I\'m going to kind of quickly review my idea for those stable coins and how they are really the Trojan horse for the CBDC\'s. And then I\'m going to show you something that kind of backs this up in a way that frankly is far more sinister than I was even thinking. It was kind of in the back of my mind it could be the case, but it\'s also now apparently happening in real time. Again, it\'s another one of these kind of tinfoil hat conspiracies that seems to manifest itself. And then, of course, we\'ll hop into some charts and check to see what\'s going on there. extraordinary strength under the hood for the stock market. I first of all wanted to give you a quick update on the indicator. Okay, the indicator website is now updated with the countdown. Okay, so there is now 20 days left before the prices are doubles. We\'ve got an official deadline for doubling the prices. So that means if you\'re already in, you have secured the lifetime discount regardless of what plan you\'re on. Okay, the plan you are currently paying will persist for lifetime. Anyone that signs up for the indicator on either one of the plans in the next 20 days will also secure those lifetime discount prices. And then once this countdown timer expires in 20 days time, the prices will double and there will be no further discounted prices. Also, I wanted to quickly shout out all the people that have shown us the different ways they use this indicator. And there\'s loads of them now. They\'re all on the website. I particularly wanted to show you this quick clip from Icy Boy here who has found a way to kind of take the indicator and use it in a completely different manner for which it was intended.", "start": 0.0, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "So you can go and watch this on the website if you\'re interested. But what he shows here is that he uses the daily time frame to find himself a window. And then he zooms into the 4hour time frame and ends up negating a bunch of the signals. He looks for a signal on the 4hour to confirm the daily cycle lows in. This enables him to get into the daily cycle low trade earlier than you otherwise would be able to. So, he\'s using 4hour cycle lows flashed by the indicator to get him earlier entries in the daily cycle low trade setups. So, I thought that was really, really cool. So, shout out to Icy for that one. Again, you can go and watch this on the website if you\'re interested. And again, you\'ve got 20 days left to secure the lifetime discount before we double the prices. Now, as I\'m sure you\'re probably well aware and as per the live stream yesterday, we got a roughly inline inflation print yesterday, it was kind of expected to be roughly in line or perceived to sticky because we know we\'ve had a counter trend wobble and we may even get one more perceived sticky inflation print next month and then of course the macro call of heading for deflation and a strong disinflationary trend should continue to play out. However, I think for the first time in a while the writing may well be on the wall. Okay, because having seen this inflation print come out, the bond market in aggregate is now using the bond futures to price in a rate cut with 96.2% probability for September\'s meeting. And I see a lot of people out here saying, \\"Well, this is really bullish. This is easier monetary policy. They\'re finally going to cut. They\'re behind the curve. This is good for markets.\\" But just keep in mind context is everything. Okay? A cut into normalization or aka a soft landing, which is inflation return into normal without a recession, is historically very bullish. Yes, panic cutting, which this is absolutely not panic cutting if it\'s already baked into the cake, right? Is also most of the time bullish when we look 3, 6, and 12 months out. However, when we are cutting into a recession or cutting into a slowdown, the market can usually withstand one, maybe two rate cuts before things get extremely red extremely fast. And you can see down the bottom here, 3, six, and 12 months out, bad things happen to the stock market following a cut into a slowdown. And given how far behind the curve we are, given how disinflationary the trend is for inflation, given how bad the labor market deterioration has been, and as if it\'s not been bad enough, they\'ve been revising these job numbers at record paces. Right? The Fed has essentially been caught red-handed now. And the BLS for engineering a controlled demolition and engineering a recession over the past six or so months. So, I think the case for this being cuts into a recession or cuts into a slowdown is stronger than ever. And I\'m sure the market is going to continue to perceive these as cuts into normalization, right?", "start": 147.66666666666666, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "And a soft landing. And therefore, my call is still that risk goes higher for a couple of months, okay, into the end of the year. And as I just said, but it is important. Historically speaking, the market can withstand one, maybe two rate cuts before it then comes tumbling down. But I think we have got a very big job here to actually see cuts into normalization and a soft landing and actually avoid a recession. I really don\'t think we\'re going to be able to do that. As ever, I\'m open to it. Right. If the market\'s going to keep going up relentlessly and there\'s no more bare markets and no more fouryear cycle lows, then I\'ve got a very good track record, a proven track record of staying on the trend. And of course, I\'m not cheering on a recession because my job as a trader is to make money. And it\'s far easier for me to make money in an environment where the market continually goes up and all dips are for buying, right? All cycle low trades resolve to new higher highs. But as I\'ve been showing every weekend on the weekend\'s deep dive, I think we are actually heading for this recessionary cut. And of course, as you can see down the bottom here, the context for that is quite bearish. three, six and 12 months after the first rate cut which potentially is September now. Okay, I say potentially unless this thing changes drastically, then I would say this is cemented that we are going to see a rate cut in September. So, you know, enjoy the party while it lasts, but keep the focus on where we are and the context of the macro. We were also covering in the last few videos that gold was going to be tariffed, okay? And maybe this would cause a giant short squeeze, but easy come, easy go with Trump these days, isn\'t it? And lots of his policies. And uh as quickly as the tariffs came for bars, they have now been removed. So we can scratch this one off and say, \\"Okay, that was a nothing burger.\\" Bob Lucas here also starting to throw around the idea, or let\'s not even call it the idea. Let\'s call it knowledge. Okay, Bob Lucas sharing knowledge and wisdom here in this tweet. He said, \\"Look, you\'ve spent two and a half years thinking about how you\'re going to handle the four-year cycle peak and what you will do and what you won\'t do, and now you\'re finally here. You\'re going to throw it all out the window once Mania takes control.\\" Okay. Okay. And I thought this chart beautifully illustrates this, right? For a long time, people were saying you buy at the four-ear cycle low, okay, and you sell kind of Q3, Q4 of this year, and then you target a 12-month bare market decline. And only once price has gotten 94% of the way through this bull phase, okay? Do suddenly the narratives like no more cycle, no more bare market, our pony forever, extended cycle, super cycle, Black Rockck\'s never going to allow an ETF draw down because it doesn\'t want its clients to lose money. Okay, insert your BS narrative here.", "start": 295.3333333333333, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "But just notice how as the tape turns greener and greener, the nonsense continues to proliferate. And it\'s our job as traders, okay, one of the biggest skill sets and advantages we can have over the market as traders is to be able to take a step back, view the sentiment objectively, and once it becomes extremely one-sided like it is starting to now, then we can take the opposite side of the trade. So just have a little conversation with yourself, right? If all through here your idea for this cycle was we\'re not selling until 2028 or we\'re diamond hand in or there\'s no more bare market then fine. You can at least say well I had an idea and I\'m sticking to my idea. But if all throughout here your idea was that we would get to Q3 Q4 and you would sell and now we\'re here. You\'re saying to yourself, well I don\'t really want to sell. I want to be a bag holder, right? I want to gamble on the idea that this fouryear cycle is just not going to show up. Right? then maybe have a conversation with yourself and ask yourself if you\'re being suckered into some kind of narrative or if you perhaps lack the discipline to stick to your original thesis. Now, if you have a very good reason for changing to new data as it becomes available, then fine, okay? It\'s not for me to tell you what\'s right or wrong. It\'s not for me to say with 100% certainty that selling in Q3 or Q4 is going to be in hindsight a good idea. It\'s just simply me saying, \\"Please consider it all. Don\'t allow the FOMO and the mania to sucker you in to becoming a bag holder and sitting through what is potentially a 70 plus bare market decline. So hopefully push cycle low one final push. Okay, I think worst case scenario we get this push weekly cycle low lower high cycle failure exit all the markets here. But as you can see we are probably pretty late in this four-year cycle now. But that\'s good because we can secure the bag and then target that four year cycle low. And that is where the QE bomb should show up. That is where the big gains in the shortest space of time should become available for the camel crew. And keeping in with this theme, okay, of being pretty late in this cycle, take a look at the CBPI. Now, this aggregates a bunch of onchain metrics and kind of cycle top indicators like the PI cycle top indicator. And it gives you a score from 0 to 100. And this is important because historically speaking, any print above about 85 is at least synonymous with local tops, if not major tops. Okay? And certainly once we get to above 95, it tends to be a exit the market and don\'t look back type of signal. In all three of the prior weekly cycle tops, we were above 80, okay? And that turned out to be pretty good. And right now, we just poked above 82 83 before having a little pullback. Now, at the hard right edge, what I speculate is going to happen is the CBBI down the bottom is likely going to reach a peak, something like this, up above 95 level, which is about here.", "start": 443.0, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "And as it does so, I speculate that Bitcoin is going to move into its final euphoric blowoff top peak before then they both come tumbling down. And remember, if all of this is occurring, okay, a CBBI above 85, certainly above 90, even 95 with the timing of the weekly cycles and the profile of the weekly cycles looking like it\'s ready to break down, okay, trend line breakdowns, confirmation fire, failed daily cycles, all the normal stuff we use to call local tops on this channel. Then for me that is going to be a big piece of confluence and confidence to take some profit to exit the major position that we have held for almost three years now since the lows and put our focus on being defensive whilst we target that four year cycle low to reallocate in 2026. Something else I just want to quickly make a note of here is as we are taking this approach okay as we are selling and as we are starting to say things like I believe this is the top or close enough to the top to call it the top and now is my time to start targeting that fouryear cycle low. What I want is for people to largely speaking not agree with me. Okay? I want people jumping up and down and calling me stupid. I want people to say, \\"No way. You\'re an idiot. Super cycle.\\" I want people to behave how they behaved with Micro Strategy. Okay? Those of you that have been here for a while will remember when we sold the top of Micro Strategy back here. Okay? You\'ll remember that people were queuing two blocks long to lynch me the moment I was invalidated on this trade and we went to new highs. Okay? You all remember back here that people were targeting me personally and attacking me personally for taking profit on a position that was acquired at the 4-year cycle lows. Okay, I nailed down a 17x on this trade because I took half off here because we couldn\'t rule out left translation at the time. Okay, but we traded this thing publicly in front of everyone. We bought the lows. Okay, we added multiple leverage positions on the way up and captured even more gains. We took half off of the core allocation here and we took the other half off at the top here before then ultimately buying it back after a 50% decline top to bottom and currently riding with whatever\'s left. Now, it is still the base case that this is not going to make a new high and is going to roll over and die and we\'re going to be locking in profits pretty sharpish on this trade. But again, note the sentiment back here. Okay, the sentiment back here was that I was a total clown. I was a total buffoon and a total idiot for selling the top. And I kept making videos and saying, \\"Good. Okay, good. I\'m glad that\'s what the masses think because if everyone was jumping up and down and cheering on short trades here and saying, \\"Yep, I\'ve also sold and no way this thing goes to new highs,\\" I would have been extremely worried. Okay? And so that is the type of sentiment I\'m looking to repeat when it comes to selling Bitcoin.", "start": 590.6666666666666, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "If I start to take some profit either in here or in here for Bitcoin and everyone is jumping up and down and telling me I\'m an idiot and a clown, okay, and that I don\'t understand what I\'m doing and that I\'m going to get my followers wrecked, then we\'re going to be taking note of that and we\'re going to be humbly using it as a tool to say, okay, we\'re probably are on the right side of the trade here and the opposite side of the herd. If when we sell, every man and his dog is jumping up and down screaming they shorted Bitcoin and they can\'t wait for the four year cycle low, then we can start to put on the idea that at the next weekly cycle low, there\'s going to be a bounce to another high and maybe then we can start to target Q1. Okay, but it will be important to push your emotions aside. Okay, take a step back and objectively observe the sentiment around the time that we start to sell the Bitcoin market. Last but not least, okay, put your tin foil hat on, okay? Because for a long time we\'ve been talking about how stable coins are probably going to be the CBDC\'s in disguise. And whilst they might not be true CBDC\'s, they will probably do some kind of rugpool on them later in life where they add the programmatic ability to those coins. They add the layers of tyranny to those stable coins later in life and then they end up being CBDC like even if they\'re not true CBDC\'s. This was the idea. And we also put a video out recently, which you can search for in the channel if you\'re interested, about how these stable coins have essentially forced crypto bros and the rest of the world to become buyers of last resort for the treasuries, okay? Funding the government years to come. And that\'s why they called this thing the genius bill or the genius act because it is just that genius, right? They figured out how to force the world to buy their treasuries through the use of these CBDC\'s in disguise that identify as stable coins. And for a long time, people were saying, \\"Yeah, well, this is really bullish Ethereum because they\'re all built on ETH and all that kind of thing.\\" And please do not misunderstand what I\'m saying here. Okay, this is not me saying ETH is going to go down from here. Okay, ETH is breaking out to new all-time highs. ETH looks extremely bullish at the moment, okay? You can\'t really argue with this, can you? Okay, look at this. Huge pump for ETH. Probably going to continue for a while longer. So, this is not me dogging on ETH or saying ETH is going to go down or anything like that. Okay. Often when I make a criticism of something under the hood for ETH, like the blockchain, the network, the people behind it, people start to call me a hater or whatever. That\'s not what this is. Okay. I am not trying to FUD your bags. I\'m not saying the price of ETH is going to go down. I hope that is extremely clear.", "start": 738.3333333333333, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "But what I am saying is a lot of people were talking about how ETH would be here for a long time because the stable coin act and these whole CBDC\'s being built on top of ETH would ensure it always has demand. It always has a use case and all of this kind of thing. Okay. But the reality is we are now moving to the next phase of this plan. The final phase of the stable coins will be dropping the blockchain altogether. And that is because Circle is going to launch ARC, a layer 1 blockchain dedicated to stable coins. Did you really think they were going to build the CBDC\'s on top of someone else\'s blockchain, right? Of course not. Absolutely no chance. But this is now the evolution. And this is actually pretty sinister if you think about it because this is the true first steps towards actually converting the stable coins from relatively harmless to CBDC like totally tyrannical programmatic money. And then of course the question I want you to ask yourself, okay? Because I already know the answer. I\'ve already made up my mind. But that doesn\'t matter, right? I just want you to ask yourself the question, okay? How much use case is there for something like Ethereum if we\'re going to move these stable coins over to their own blockchains? Okay, you may think there\'s a lot of use case, but I make the case under the hood there\'s a lot of problems with that blockchain. No one really wants it other than to pump their bags and either get more fiat or more Bitcoin. And again, this is not me clowning on this or being a hater because you can\'t argue with the charts, right? The charts are the truth. The charts don\'t lie. This is a huge pump for Ethereum. So, anyone that is making more fiat or using that fiat to buy more Bitcoin, you know, you\'re winning. You\'re doing your job. Okay? So, it\'s business. It\'s not personal. But if we are going to remove the stable coin use case from Ethereum, then how much future do you really think this blockchain has? One thing we\'re not wrong about at the moment though is the S&P 500 closing new alltime highs. I don\'t like being overly bullish. Okay, normally when I\'m overly bullish, the market will turn around and punish me. Something I cannot really get away from. Okay, first of all, we\'re early in the cycles. Okay, cycles doing cycle things. We\'re about to move this future cycle low window to the next one and target that. And that\'s happy days. Okay, but look at this. Okay, this is something that I don\'t know, man. I\'m going to show I\'m going to share it with you. Okay, don\'t judge me. The question I want to ask is why are all these pullbacks here getting smaller and smaller and smaller on the way up? Okay, and the only answer I\'ve got for you is because these are nesting ones and twos. Okay?", "start": 886.0, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "Now, if these are nesting ones and twos, which I believe they are, because otherwise we can\'t explain the fact each one of these pullbacks is getting shallower on the way up, then the only option out of here, okay, are 3 4 3 4 3 4 and then five later on. This is the only option, which means this is actually the making of the blowoff top. And the reason I am so excited about this, but also a bit hesitant, like I said, usually when I\'m super duper uber bullish, the market has to come back and be like, whoa, chill out camel. Okay, you\'re getting ahead of yourself, but I was talking about this with the members and I think with the slice crew as well. This whole thing reminds me a lot of the meltup post C19. Okay, this here we had this big crash for C19. We went back to alltime highs. We chopped and then we just went absolutely bananas. And I know in the context zoomed out like this, it doesn\'t look that insane. But anyone that has traded through this period of time right here, anyone that was in the stock market actively trading this thing during this time will know this blew everyone\'s mind. This was the most insanely bullish thing ever. Every morning I woke up thinking, \\"Okay, here comes the top.\\" And it just relentlessly went up. I could not believe the underlying strength for this move. This was absolutely bananas off of that C19 low. And to me that what we\'ve got at the moment is extremely reminiscent of that. Okay, all of the pullbacks are getting smaller and smaller. And the only explanation I have for that is because they are indeed nesting ones and twos at smaller wave degrees. And like I said earlier, that means we\'re going to go 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 5 on the way out of here, which is exactly what we did back here. This is already more relentless than the recovery from the C19 lows. And I think we\'re probably going to do it a lot quicker and a lot more vertical to be completely honest with you. Now again, I could easily be way too bullish here. Okay, I could. But if we\'re going to have a blowoff top before coming tumbling down in a big bare market recession like the weekend\'s deep dives have been suggesting, if we\'re going to start to head for those four year cycle lows for not just Bitcoin, but also for the S&P and gold, then doesn\'t ending in a firework type bang here make a lot of sense? I don\'t know. Okay, I don\'t know. Again, I\'m always cautious when I suddenly flip to being super duper uber bullish because typically speaking, the market will have a way of being like, \\"Chill out camel.\\" Okay, go home. You\'re drunk. Okay, but at the same time, if anyone, and I\'m being serious when I ask this, if anyone has another explanation for why each one of these is getting smaller on the way up, okay, I would love to hear it because as far as I\'m concerned, these are all nesting ones and twos. And that means, like I said a million times, we\'re about to go absolutely vertical out of here. There\'s no other way, okay?", "start": 1033.6666666666665, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "And the more that the market continues to just push to all-time highs, okay, and make smaller and smaller degree corrections, then the more this actually becomes the base case.

What else is there to say? Gold still not really moved, has it? But I think it\'s about to as I\'ve been saying over and over again.

All right. Hello and welcome to Camel Finance. I\'m your boy Camel and today I want to briefly talk about the CPI print we saw yesterday, interest rate cuts, context for the interest rate cuts, and then I want to kind of continue to beat this same drum of not getting sucked into the narrative, not moving the gold post, that kind of thing. I want to show you some context for where we are in this major four-year cycle and then you can take it or leave it. I also want to review the CBBI index and then drop a little bit of a speculation as to what is likely coming with these stable coins, the stable coin act. Of course, we\'ve been covering this for a long time on this channel on and off as new data presented itself. We\'ve been good at staying on top of that. So, I\'m going to kind of quickly review my idea for those stable coins and how they are really the Trojan horse for the CBDC\'s. And then I\'m going to show you something that kind of backs this up in a way that frankly is far more sinister than I was even thinking. It was kind of in the back of my mind it could be the case, but it\'s also now apparently happening in real time. Again, it\'s another one of these kind of tinfoil hat conspiracies that seems to manifest itself. And then, of course, we\'ll hop into some charts and check to see what\'s going on there. extraordinary strength under the hood for the stock market. I first of all wanted to give you a quick update on the indicator. Okay, the indicator website is now updated with the countdown. Okay, so there is now 20 days left before the prices are doubles. We\'ve got an official deadline for doubling the prices. So that means if you\'re already in, you have secured the lifetime discount regardless of what plan you\'re on. Okay, the plan you are currently paying will persist for lifetime. Anyone that signs up for the indicator on either one of the plans in the next 20 days will also secure those lifetime discount prices. And then once this countdown timer expires in 20 days time, the prices will double and there will be no further discounted prices. Also, I wanted to quickly shout out all the people that have shown us the different ways they use this indicator. And there\'s loads of them now. They\'re all on the website. I particularly wanted to show you this quick clip from Icy Boy here who has found a way to kind of take the indicator and use it in a completely different manner for which it was intended.", "start": 0.0, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "So you can go and watch this on the website if you\'re interested. But what he shows here is that he uses the daily time frame to find himself a window. And then he zooms into the 4hour time frame and ends up negating a bunch of the signals. He looks for a signal on the 4hour to confirm the daily cycle lows in. This enables him to get into the daily cycle low trade earlier than you otherwise would be able to. So, he\'s using 4hour cycle lows flashed by the indicator to get him earlier entries in the daily cycle low trade setups. So, I thought that was really, really cool. So, shout out to Icy for that one. Again, you can go and watch this on the website if you\'re interested. And again, you\'ve got 20 days left to secure the lifetime discount before we double the prices. Now, as I\'m sure you\'re probably well aware and as per the live stream yesterday, we got a roughly inline inflation print yesterday, it was kind of expected to be roughly in line or perceived to sticky because we know we\'ve had a counter trend wobble and we may even get one more perceived sticky inflation print next month and then of course the macro call of heading for deflation and a strong disinflationary trend should continue to play out. However, I think for the first time in a while the writing may well be on the wall. Okay, because having seen this inflation print come out, the bond market in aggregate is now using the bond futures to price in a rate cut with 96.2% probability for September\'s meeting. And I see a lot of people out here saying, \\"Well, this is really bullish. This is easier monetary policy. They\'re finally going to cut. They\'re behind the curve. This is good for markets.\\" But just keep in mind context is everything. Okay? A cut into normalization or aka a soft landing, which is inflation return into normal without a recession, is historically very bullish. Yes, panic cutting, which this is absolutely not panic cutting if it\'s already baked into the cake, right? Is also most of the time bullish when we look 3, 6, and 12 months out. However, when we are cutting into a recession or cutting into a slowdown, the market can usually withstand one, maybe two rate cuts before things get extremely red extremely fast. And you can see down the bottom here, 3, six, and 12 months out, bad things happen to the stock market following a cut into a slowdown. And given how far behind the curve we are, given how disinflationary the trend is for inflation, given how bad the labor market deterioration has been, and as if it\'s not been bad enough, they\'ve been revising these job numbers at record paces. Right? The Fed has essentially been caught red-handed now. And the BLS for engineering a controlled demolition and engineering a recession over the past six or so months. So, I think the case for this being cuts into a recession or cuts into a slowdown is stronger than ever. And I\'m sure the market is going to continue to perceive these as cuts into normalization, right?", "start": 147.66666666666666, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "And a soft landing. And therefore, my call is still that risk goes higher for a couple of months, okay, into the end of the year. And as I just said, but it is important. Historically speaking, the market can withstand one, maybe two rate cuts before it then comes tumbling down. But I think we have got a very big job here to actually see cuts into normalization and a soft landing and actually avoid a recession. I really don\'t think we\'re going to be able to do that. As ever, I\'m open to it. Right. If the market\'s going to keep going up relentlessly and there\'s no more bare markets and no more fouryear cycle lows, then I\'ve got a very good track record, a proven track record of staying on the trend. And of course, I\'m not cheering on a recession because my job as a trader is to make money. And it\'s far easier for me to make money in an environment where the market continually goes up and all dips are for buying, right? All cycle low trades resolve to new higher highs. But as I\'ve been showing every weekend on the weekend\'s deep dive, I think we are actually heading for this recessionary cut. And of course, as you can see down the bottom here, the context for that is quite bearish. three, six and 12 months after the first rate cut which potentially is September now. Okay, I say potentially unless this thing changes drastically, then I would say this is cemented that we are going to see a rate cut in September. So, you know, enjoy the party while it lasts, but keep the focus on where we are and the context of the macro. We were also covering in the last few videos that gold was going to be tariffed, okay? And maybe this would cause a giant short squeeze, but easy come, easy go with Trump these days, isn\'t it? And lots of his policies. And uh as quickly as the tariffs came for bars, they have now been removed. So we can scratch this one off and say, \\"Okay, that was a nothing burger.\\" Bob Lucas here also starting to throw around the idea, or let\'s not even call it the idea. Let\'s call it knowledge. Okay, Bob Lucas sharing knowledge and wisdom here in this tweet. He said, \\"Look, you\'ve spent two and a half years thinking about how you\'re going to handle the four-year cycle peak and what you will do and what you won\'t do, and now you\'re finally here. You\'re going to throw it all out the window once Mania takes control.\\" Okay. Okay. And I thought this chart beautifully illustrates this, right? For a long time, people were saying you buy at the four-ear cycle low, okay, and you sell kind of Q3, Q4 of this year, and then you target a 12-month bare market decline. And only once price has gotten 94% of the way through this bull phase, okay? Do suddenly the narratives like no more cycle, no more bare market, our pony forever, extended cycle, super cycle, Black Rockck\'s never going to allow an ETF draw down because it doesn\'t want its clients to lose money. Okay, insert your BS narrative here.", "start": 295.3333333333333, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "But just notice how as the tape turns greener and greener, the nonsense continues to proliferate. And it\'s our job as traders, okay, one of the biggest skill sets and advantages we can have over the market as traders is to be able to take a step back, view the sentiment objectively, and once it becomes extremely one-sided like it is starting to now, then we can take the opposite side of the trade. So just have a little conversation with yourself, right? If all through here your idea for this cycle was we\'re not selling until 2028 or we\'re diamond hand in or there\'s no more bare market then fine. You can at least say well I had an idea and I\'m sticking to my idea. But if all throughout here your idea was that we would get to Q3 Q4 and you would sell and now we\'re here. You\'re saying to yourself, well I don\'t really want to sell. I want to be a bag holder, right? I want to gamble on the idea that this fouryear cycle is just not going to show up. Right? then maybe have a conversation with yourself and ask yourself if you\'re being suckered into some kind of narrative or if you perhaps lack the discipline to stick to your original thesis. Now, if you have a very good reason for changing to new data as it becomes available, then fine, okay? It\'s not for me to tell you what\'s right or wrong. It\'s not for me to say with 100% certainty that selling in Q3 or Q4 is going to be in hindsight a good idea. It\'s just simply me saying, \\"Please consider it all. Don\'t allow the FOMO and the mania to sucker you in to becoming a bag holder and sitting through what is potentially a 70 plus bare market decline. So hopefully push cycle low one final push. Okay, I think worst case scenario we get this push weekly cycle low lower high cycle failure exit all the markets here. But as you can see we are probably pretty late in this four-year cycle now. But that\'s good because we can secure the bag and then target that four year cycle low. And that is where the QE bomb should show up. That is where the big gains in the shortest space of time should become available for the camel crew. And keeping in with this theme, okay, of being pretty late in this cycle, take a look at the CBPI. Now, this aggregates a bunch of onchain metrics and kind of cycle top indicators like the PI cycle top indicator. And it gives you a score from 0 to 100. And this is important because historically speaking, any print above about 85 is at least synonymous with local tops, if not major tops. Okay? And certainly once we get to above 95, it tends to be a exit the market and don\'t look back type of signal. In all three of the prior weekly cycle tops, we were above 80, okay? And that turned out to be pretty good. And right now, we just poked above 82 83 before having a little pullback. Now, at the hard right edge, what I speculate is going to happen is the CBBI down the bottom is likely going to reach a peak, something like this, up above 95 level, which is about here.", "start": 443.0, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "And as it does so, I speculate that Bitcoin is going to move into its final euphoric blowoff top peak before then they both come tumbling down. And remember, if all of this is occurring, okay, a CBBI above 85, certainly above 90, even 95 with the timing of the weekly cycles and the profile of the weekly cycles looking like it\'s ready to break down, okay, trend line breakdowns, confirmation fire, failed daily cycles, all the normal stuff we use to call local tops on this channel. Then for me that is going to be a big piece of confluence and confidence to take some profit to exit the major position that we have held for almost three years now since the lows and put our focus on being defensive whilst we target that four year cycle low to reallocate in 2026. Something else I just want to quickly make a note of here is as we are taking this approach okay as we are selling and as we are starting to say things like I believe this is the top or close enough to the top to call it the top and now is my time to start targeting that fouryear cycle low. What I want is for people to largely speaking not agree with me. Okay? I want people jumping up and down and calling me stupid. I want people to say, \\"No way. You\'re an idiot. Super cycle.\\" I want people to behave how they behaved with Micro Strategy. Okay? Those of you that have been here for a while will remember when we sold the top of Micro Strategy back here. Okay? You\'ll remember that people were queuing two blocks long to lynch me the moment I was invalidated on this trade and we went to new highs. Okay? You all remember back here that people were targeting me personally and attacking me personally for taking profit on a position that was acquired at the 4-year cycle lows. Okay, I nailed down a 17x on this trade because I took half off here because we couldn\'t rule out left translation at the time. Okay, but we traded this thing publicly in front of everyone. We bought the lows. Okay, we added multiple leverage positions on the way up and captured even more gains. We took half off of the core allocation here and we took the other half off at the top here before then ultimately buying it back after a 50% decline top to bottom and currently riding with whatever\'s left. Now, it is still the base case that this is not going to make a new high and is going to roll over and die and we\'re going to be locking in profits pretty sharpish on this trade. But again, note the sentiment back here. Okay, the sentiment back here was that I was a total clown. I was a total buffoon and a total idiot for selling the top. And I kept making videos and saying, \\"Good. Okay, good. I\'m glad that\'s what the masses think because if everyone was jumping up and down and cheering on short trades here and saying, \\"Yep, I\'ve also sold and no way this thing goes to new highs,\\" I would have been extremely worried. Okay? And so that is the type of sentiment I\'m looking to repeat when it comes to selling Bitcoin.", "start": 590.6666666666666, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "If I start to take some profit either in here or in here for Bitcoin and everyone is jumping up and down and telling me I\'m an idiot and a clown, okay, and that I don\'t understand what I\'m doing and that I\'m going to get my followers wrecked, then we\'re going to be taking note of that and we\'re going to be humbly using it as a tool to say, okay, we\'re probably are on the right side of the trade here and the opposite side of the herd. If when we sell, every man and his dog is jumping up and down screaming they shorted Bitcoin and they can\'t wait for the four year cycle low, then we can start to put on the idea that at the next weekly cycle low, there\'s going to be a bounce to another high and maybe then we can start to target Q1. Okay, but it will be important to push your emotions aside. Okay, take a step back and objectively observe the sentiment around the time that we start to sell the Bitcoin market. Last but not least, okay, put your tin foil hat on, okay? Because for a long time we\'ve been talking about how stable coins are probably going to be the CBDC\'s in disguise. And whilst they might not be true CBDC\'s, they will probably do some kind of rugpool on them later in life where they add the programmatic ability to those coins. They add the layers of tyranny to those stable coins later in life and then they end up being CBDC like even if they\'re not true CBDC\'s. This was the idea. And we also put a video out recently, which you can search for in the channel if you\'re interested, about how these stable coins have essentially forced crypto bros and the rest of the world to become buyers of last resort for the treasuries, okay? Funding the government years to come. And that\'s why they called this thing the genius bill or the genius act because it is just that genius, right? They figured out how to force the world to buy their treasuries through the use of these CBDC\'s in disguise that identify as stable coins. And for a long time, people were saying, \\"Yeah, well, this is really bullish Ethereum because they\'re all built on ETH and all that kind of thing.\\" And please do not misunderstand what I\'m saying here. Okay, this is not me saying ETH is going to go down from here. Okay, ETH is breaking out to new all-time highs. ETH looks extremely bullish at the moment, okay? You can\'t really argue with this, can you? Okay, look at this. Huge pump for ETH. Probably going to continue for a while longer. So, this is not me dogging on ETH or saying ETH is going to go down or anything like that. Okay. Often when I make a criticism of something under the hood for ETH, like the blockchain, the network, the people behind it, people start to call me a hater or whatever. That\'s not what this is. Okay. I am not trying to FUD your bags. I\'m not saying the price of ETH is going to go down. I hope that is extremely clear.", "start": 738.3333333333333, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "But what I am saying is a lot of people were talking about how ETH would be here for a long time because the stable coin act and these whole CBDC\'s being built on top of ETH would ensure it always has demand. It always has a use case and all of this kind of thing. Okay. But the reality is we are now moving to the next phase of this plan. The final phase of the stable coins will be dropping the blockchain altogether. And that is because Circle is going to launch ARC, a layer 1 blockchain dedicated to stable coins. Did you really think they were going to build the CBDC\'s on top of someone else\'s blockchain, right? Of course not. Absolutely no chance. But this is now the evolution. And this is actually pretty sinister if you think about it because this is the true first steps towards actually converting the stable coins from relatively harmless to CBDC like totally tyrannical programmatic money. And then of course the question I want you to ask yourself, okay? Because I already know the answer. I\'ve already made up my mind. But that doesn\'t matter, right? I just want you to ask yourself the question, okay? How much use case is there for something like Ethereum if we\'re going to move these stable coins over to their own blockchains? Okay, you may think there\'s a lot of use case, but I make the case under the hood there\'s a lot of problems with that blockchain. No one really wants it other than to pump their bags and either get more fiat or more Bitcoin. And again, this is not me clowning on this or being a hater because you can\'t argue with the charts, right? The charts are the truth. The charts don\'t lie. This is a huge pump for Ethereum. So, anyone that is making more fiat or using that fiat to buy more Bitcoin, you know, you\'re winning. You\'re doing your job. Okay? So, it\'s business. It\'s not personal. But if we are going to remove the stable coin use case from Ethereum, then how much future do you really think this blockchain has? One thing we\'re not wrong about at the moment though is the S&P 500 closing new alltime highs. I don\'t like being overly bullish. Okay, normally when I\'m overly bullish, the market will turn around and punish me. Something I cannot really get away from. Okay, first of all, we\'re early in the cycles. Okay, cycles doing cycle things. We\'re about to move this future cycle low window to the next one and target that. And that\'s happy days. Okay, but look at this. Okay, this is something that I don\'t know, man. I\'m going to show I\'m going to share it with you. Okay, don\'t judge me. The question I want to ask is why are all these pullbacks here getting smaller and smaller and smaller on the way up? Okay, and the only answer I\'ve got for you is because these are nesting ones and twos. Okay?", "start": 886.0, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "Now, if these are nesting ones and twos, which I believe they are, because otherwise we can\'t explain the fact each one of these pullbacks is getting shallower on the way up, then the only option out of here, okay, are 3 4 3 4 3 4 and then five later on. This is the only option, which means this is actually the making of the blowoff top. And the reason I am so excited about this, but also a bit hesitant, like I said, usually when I\'m super duper uber bullish, the market has to come back and be like, whoa, chill out camel. Okay, you\'re getting ahead of yourself, but I was talking about this with the members and I think with the slice crew as well. This whole thing reminds me a lot of the meltup post C19. Okay, this here we had this big crash for C19. We went back to alltime highs. We chopped and then we just went absolutely bananas. And I know in the context zoomed out like this, it doesn\'t look that insane. But anyone that has traded through this period of time right here, anyone that was in the stock market actively trading this thing during this time will know this blew everyone\'s mind. This was the most insanely bullish thing ever. Every morning I woke up thinking, \\"Okay, here comes the top.\\" And it just relentlessly went up. I could not believe the underlying strength for this move. This was absolutely bananas off of that C19 low. And to me that what we\'ve got at the moment is extremely reminiscent of that. Okay, all of the pullbacks are getting smaller and smaller. And the only explanation I have for that is because they are indeed nesting ones and twos at smaller wave degrees. And like I said earlier, that means we\'re going to go 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 5 on the way out of here, which is exactly what we did back here. This is already more relentless than the recovery from the C19 lows. And I think we\'re probably going to do it a lot quicker and a lot more vertical to be completely honest with you. Now again, I could easily be way too bullish here. Okay, I could. But if we\'re going to have a blowoff top before coming tumbling down in a big bare market recession like the weekend\'s deep dives have been suggesting, if we\'re going to start to head for those four year cycle lows for not just Bitcoin, but also for the S&P and gold, then doesn\'t ending in a firework type bang here make a lot of sense? I don\'t know. Okay, I don\'t know. Again, I\'m always cautious when I suddenly flip to being super duper uber bullish because typically speaking, the market will have a way of being like, \\"Chill out camel.\\" Okay, go home. You\'re drunk. Okay, but at the same time, if anyone, and I\'m being serious when I ask this, if anyone has another explanation for why each one of these is getting smaller on the way up, okay, I would love to hear it because as far as I\'m concerned, these are all nesting ones and twos. And that means, like I said a million times, we\'re about to go absolutely vertical out of here. There\'s no other way, okay?", "start": 1033.6666666666665, "duration": 147.66666666666666}, {"text": "And the more that the market continues to just push to all-time highs, okay, and make smaller and smaller degree corrections, then the more this actually becomes the base case. So again, I\'m always cautious when I start to be talking extremely super duper uber bullish here. But then again, we are at the end of these four-ear cycles, okay? And that\'s where all the work tends to get covered. If I zoom out and go to this Bitcoin alltime price history index, you know, it is in the final push that all of the gains for the cycle get made. Okay, it\'s in the final few months that all of the gains for the cycle get made. It\'s in the final few months that all of the gains for the cycle get made. And we are now in the final few months where potentially all of the gains for the cycle are going to get made. So, I don\'t know, man. Let me know what you think. Am I too bullish? Do I need to calm down a bit? Maybe. Okay. But equally, we are late in those four year cycles and that tends to be where the quote banana zone occurs. Okay, so summon the banana with me. What else is there to say? Gold still not really moved, has it? But I think it\'s about to as I\'ve been saying over and over again. The reason I say that is I believe we\'ve reset the weekly cycle now. I believe this is the ABCDE complete with one and two. And now we\'re going to break out on three, four, and five. And I believe the senior miners already leading the way. Well, it\'s not even a belief anymore. They are clearly leading the way. So are the junior miners. So are the CJ positions. 17 handle now and gapping up. Okay. So happy days. And if you\'re a level three member, everything that will be accumulated down here is going to get dumped at the top of this weekly cycle as we then start to target the fourear cycle low for gold. And that\'s it. Love you all. Right? Have a fantastic rest of the week. Let me know what you think about the super duper uber bullish case. You got 20 days to grab yourself a lifetime discount on the indicator and everything that comes with it. I\'m your boy Camel. Until next time, all the best. Cheers. Bye. Camel finance.
