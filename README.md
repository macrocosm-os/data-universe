# Introduction

Subnet 13, Data Universe, is a data-scraping and sentiment analysis subnet owned by Macrocosmos.ai. It collects and stores large amounts of data from across a wide-range of sources for use by other Subnets and businesses. Data Universe scrapes real-time data from X (formerly known as Twitter), Reddit, and YouTube transcripts.

Data Universe is currently the world's largest open-source social media dataset, highlighting its efficiency and business use cases. Its datasets are easy to access, so businesses and other subnets can use them quickly and with low-friction.

Data Universe was built from the ground-up with a focus on decentralization and scalability. There is no centralized entity that controls the data; the data is stored across all Miners on the network, and is queryable via the Validators. At launch, Data Universe is able to support up to 50 Petabytes of data across 200 miners, while only requiring ~10GB of storage on the Validator.

# Products

Macrocosmos has launched its own products built with subnet 13:

## Gravity

This flagship product allows you to send data-scraping jobs to the network, choosing specific key terms and phrases to collect. This functions on both X and Reddit, with YouTube scraping support coming soon. Gravity is a highly accessible no-code tool that can be used by anyone, regardless of technical background. It's also a low-cost solution to data-scraping and sentiment analysis, undercutting many centralized and decentralized alternatives on the market.

Companies can also get sentiment analysis included within their scraping tasks, helping to quickly gauge public perception, identify emerging trends, and make data-driven decisions.


# Overview

The Data Universe documentation assumes you are familiar with basic Bittensor concepts: Miners, Validators, and incentives. If you need a primer, please check out https://docs.bittensor.com/learn/bittensor-building-blocks.

In the Data Universe, Miners scrape data from a defined set of sources, called DataSources. Each piece of data (e.g. a webpage, BTC prices), called a DataEntity, is stored in the miner's database. Each DataEntity belongs to exactly one DataEntityBucket, which is uniquely identified by its DataEntityBucketId, a tuple of: where the data came from (DataSource), when it was created (TimeBucket), and a classification of the data (DataLabel, e.g. a stock ticker symbol). The full set of DataEntityBuckets on a Miner is referred to as its MinerIndex.

Validators periodically query each Miner to fetch their latest MinerIndexes and store them in a local database. This gives the Validator a complete understanding of all data that's stored on the network, as well as which Miners to query for specific types of data. Validators also periodically verify the correctness of the data stored on Miners and reward Miners based on the amount of [valuable data](#data-value) the Miner has. Validators log to [wandb](https://wandb.ai/macrocosmos/data-universe-validators) anonymously by default.

Miners upload their local stores to either HuggingFace or S3-compatible storage for public dataset access. This data is anonymized for privacy purposes to comply with the Terms of Service per each data source.

- For HuggingFace setup, see the [HuggingFace documentation](docs/huggingface_setup.md).
- For S3 storage setup, see the [S3 Storage documentation](https://github.com/macrocosm-os/data-universe-api).

The S3 storage option provides improved scalability, security, and performance, especially for large datasets. It uses a folder-based structure with blockchain authentication to ensure miners can only access their own data while validators can efficiently access all miners' data.

See the [Miner](docs/miner.md) and [Validator](docs/validator.md) docs for more information about how they work, as well as setup instructions.

# Incentive Mechanism

As described above, each Miner reports its MinerIndex to the Validator. The MinerIndex details how much and what type of data the Miner has. The Miner is then scored based on 2 dimensions:
1. How much data the Miner has and how valuable that data is.
1. How credible the Miner is.

## Data Value

Not all data is equally valuable! There are several factors used to determine data value:

### 1) Data Freshness

Fresh data is more valuable than old data, and data older than a certain threshold is not scored.

As of Dec 11th, 2023 data older than 30 days is not scored. This may increase in future.

### 2) Data Desirability

Data Universe maintains a [Dynamic Desirability List](docs/dynamic_desirability.md) that defines which types of data are desirable according to user requests from [Gravity](https://app.macrocosmos.ai/), the Data Universe product. Data deemed desirable is scored more highly. Unspecified labels get the default_scale_factor of 0.3, meaning they score less than half value in comparison.

The DataDesirabilityLookup will evolve over time, but each change will be announced ahead of time to give Miners adequate time to prepare for the update.

### 3) Duplication Factor

Data that's stored by many Miners is less valuable than data stored by only a few. The value of a piece of data is decreases proportional to the number of Miners storing it.

## Miner Credibility

Validators remain suspicious of Miners and so they periodically check a sample of data from each Miner's MinerIndex, to verify the data correctness. The Validator uses these checks to track a Miner's credibility, which it then uses to scale a Miner's score. The scaling is done in such a way that it is **always** worse for a Miner to misrepresent what types and how much data it has.

# Data Universe Dashboard

As you can see from the above, Data Universe rewards diversity of data (storing 200 copies of the same data isn't exactly beneficial!)

To help understand the current data on the Subnet, the Data Universe team hosts a dashboard (https://sn13-dashboard.api.macrocosmos.ai/), showing the amount of each type of data (by DataEntityBucketId) on the Subnet. Miners are strongly encouraged to use this dashboard to customize their [Miner Configuration](./docs/miner.md#configuring-the-miner), to maximize their rewards.

# Use Cases

Subnet 13, Data Universe, has a range of use-cases:

- Low-cost data-scraping that undercuts centralized and decentralized alternatives.
- Aid in market research in any industry by collecting social media results on pressing topics.
- Help boost the accuracy of predictive tools by injecting them with freshly scraped social media data.
- Understand global online sentiment on any topic, to help inform businesses on their goals.
- Track sports analytics on social media (used by Subnet 44, Score).
- Forecast performance of assets (used by Subnet 64, Chutes, via Squad.ai).

Data-Universe's potential is extensive, as anybody can use it to build datasets on whatever topics are meaningful to them. By tapping into Bittensor's miner and validator communities, people can access data scraping and analysis at a fast and affordable rate.

# Terminology

**DataDesirabilityLookup:** A [defined list of rules](https://github.com/RusticLuftig/data-universe/blob/main/rewards/data_desirability_lookup.py) that determine how desirable data is, based on its DataSource and DataLabel.

**DataEntity:** A single "item" of data collected by a Miner. Each DataEntity has a URI, that the Validators can use to retrieve the item from its DataSource.

**DataEntityBucket:** A logical grouping of DataEntities, based on its DataEntityBucketId.

**DataEntityBucketId:** The unique identifier for a DataEntityBucket. It contains the TimeBucket, DataSource, and DataLabel.

**DataLabel:** A label associated with a DataEntity. Precisely what the label represents is unique to the DataSource. For example, for a Yahoo finance DataSource, the label is the stock ticker of the finance data.

**DataSource:** A source from which Miners scrape data.

**Miner Credibility**: A per-miner rating, based on how often they pass data validation checks. Used to heavily penalize Miner's who misrepresent their MinerIndex.

**Miner Index**: A summary of how much and what types of data a Miner has. Specifically, it's a list of DataEntityBuckets.
